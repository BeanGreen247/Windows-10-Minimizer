# Windows 10 Minimizer
A utility to make your Windows 10 install more lightweight.

The goal of this project is to make optimizing Windows as simple as clicking a button or two and be done.

More features will be added as I see fit, or if there is demand for it.

## Changelog
#### v 1.0 released
* Optimize Windows 10 by running scripts with the click of a button
* Disable services the same way
* Ability to enable Windows Update if needed

Let me know what you think of it. You can also submit your ideas.
