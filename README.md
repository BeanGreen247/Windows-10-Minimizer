# Windows 10 Minimizer

## **WARNING**

This tool will remove most metro apps and will leave the core ones need for system stability.

It will remove apps like Photos, The preinstalled games and Office Ad.

It will also prevent these apps from being reinstalled in your system so **bare that in mind**.

The startup script may cause some printers and scanners to not work properly, so **use this tool at your own risk**.

In my case it **did not**, I repeat **did not** affect my workflow a single bit, **but your experience may warry**.

## Description

A utility to make your Windows 10 install more lightweight.

The goal of this project is to make optimizing Windows as simple as clicking a button or two and be done.

More features will be added as I see fit, or if there is demand for it.
